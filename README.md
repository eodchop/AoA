AoA is a combination old school text based RPG with modern MMORPG elements mixed in.  A user can explore an interact with AoA's game world and other characters via the many different text commands available.

Players can log in via authenticating through firebase with google credentials, new players will be prompted with a create character menu:

Once a user has created a character they can press the 'Show Character Panel' button below the game window to display the left modal with character information like: name, clas, stats, and inventory.

After logging in/creating a character the user is entered into Hammerhelm Tavern where other players also drop in.


Clicking the 'Show Command List' button below the game window will pop out a left modal that displays all of AoA's many commands and their shortcuts:

Above an "/inspect" command was entered in Hammerhelm Tavern and a list of items 'in' the area which the user can interact with is displayed.

Inspecting any of these objects will give the user a little information below the game window:

Traveling around AoA is easy with commands and shortcuts, pressing '/m' or '/map' will show a list places you can access from your current location:

Then enter '/t' or '/travel' and the new area you would like to travel to:

Once you've traveled to a new location, you can use '/e' or "/enemies" to see a list of monsters in the area that you can fight for experience to increase your level, and a random chance at getting new/better gear for you character.  Slain monsters are repopulated frequently by a respawn function that executes every few minutes so don't worry about running out of things to beat up on.

You can fight an enemy by using '/atk' and the index number of the enemy in the area, for example below Ford Prefect fought a low level skeleton using '/atk 1'.  After you attack the enemies will automatically counterattack.  You can see the damage done to Ford on his health bar in the top right.  Using a '/sit' command to rest will help regain lost Health.

Soon after defeating that skeleton a Wraith 'spawned' in the defeated skeleton's index- wraith's are little more powerful than Ford at his current level.  Luckily each class comes with special skills which can be viewed by entering '/skills'.

Ford used the 'Overdraw' ranger skill to hit the wraith for high damage:

Using it again defeated the wraith, raised Ford's level by one increasing his stats and refilling his Health and Mana (skill point) meters to full.  In addition the wraith dropped a 'Rusty Sword' - not much but an improvement over the rusty stick he had before:

The Rusty Sword is easy to swap out for the Rusty Stick using '/eqp rusty sword' and you will see his attack power has increased from 1 to 3!

However level 2 and an Attack Power of 3 are not even close to strong enough to take on some of AoA's more powerful creatures.  Login and see for yourself at https://eodchop.github.io/AoA/
